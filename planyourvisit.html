      First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

          <p>Make sure that you are dressed for the season. You should also always bring extra clothing just in case you get wet, and a jacket or a coat if you are going to be at the park late. Weather and tempratures can vary and change quickly so generally layering clothing is best.</p>

          <p>Making sure that you are hydrated and well fueled is very imortant, especially if you are engaging in extra physical activities. Bring water and healthy snacks, like nuts or trailmix, to keep you going strong. And if you are staying to camp, don't forget the marshmallows!</p>
